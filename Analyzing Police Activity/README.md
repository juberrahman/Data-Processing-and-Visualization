I have explored the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyzed the impact of gender, weather on police behavior to find answers to the questions below:

* Do the genders commit different violations?
* Does gender affect who gets a ticket for speeding?
* Does gender affect whose vehicle is searched?
* Does gender affect who is frisked during a search?
* Does time of day affect arrest rate?
* Are drug related stops on the rise?
* How long you might be stopped for a violation?
* Does wather affect the arrest rate?

The skillset include cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data. Qurious ? have a look on my notebook.
