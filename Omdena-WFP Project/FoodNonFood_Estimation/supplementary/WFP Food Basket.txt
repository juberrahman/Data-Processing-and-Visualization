What’s in a WFP food basket?
In emergencies or refugee situations, when people are completely dependent on food assistance, the main components of the WFP food basket are:

1. a staple such as wheat flour or rice;
2. lentils, chickpeas or other pulses;
3. vegetable oil (fortified with vitamin A and D);
4. sugar; and
5. iodized salt
6. The supplementary ration – used when people have access to some but not enough food – often consists of a fortified blended food, sugar and vegetable oil.

An alternative could be a ready-to-eat food fortified with vitamins and minerals, which does not require any cooking or preparation.
